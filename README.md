# ANALYSIS OF MATERNAL HEALTH RISK DATASET
The issue of maternal mortality is of huge concern in some developing nations. Efforts have been in top gear to identify and mitigate the influencing factors impacting childbirth. In this project, I utilized SQL, Python, and Tableau to identify some of these factors and the relevant patterns across diverse age groups. 

# Two objectives were pursued:
1. To identify the most influential factor that determines the maternal mortality
3. To build a system capable of taking in some relevant inputs and predicting the maternal risk level as an outcome.

# Outcome:
1. Age is a major determinant of maternal mortality risk level.
2. Other factors like blood pressure, and glucose level are influential too.
3. Higher percentage of low-risk mortality rates were dominant in ages less than 30
4. The higher the age, the higher the risk level.
5. Higher blood pressure was observed in individuals categorized as having a high-risk level of maternal mortality.
